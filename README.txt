(b) How to Build the Project:

Included is the zip file with CSC242_CompleteProject3 directory. Inside terminal, cd inside directory (CSC242_CompleteProject3):
(assuming current working directory is where the ‘CSC_242_Project_3_v2 ’ un-zipped folder is, run the following commands).

Commands to run (after unzipping and changing directory to inside zip folder where README.txt is and the WriteUp_Tyler.pdf): 

1.	cd CSC_242_Project_3_v2
2.	cd src
3.	javac *.java				      (this compiles)
4. 	java Enumerator aima-alarm.xml B J true M true        (example run command)

(c) How to run your project’s program(s) to demonstrate that it meets the requirements:

Run Commands: 
	Part 1: 
java Enumerator aima-alarm.xml B J true M true
java Enumerator aima-wet-grass.xml R S true
	Part 2: 
java Sampler 1000 aima-alarm.xml B J true M true

You can pretty much run the commands as they are in the project description.
